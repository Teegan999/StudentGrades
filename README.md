# StudentGrades
I made a student grades console app in Java 
The app allows a user to enter their marks/grades and it is saved in an array
the array is used by a for-loop, the for-loop enables the user to enter the 5 marks
The app also allows the user to check their grades again and check their final average 
Finally, the app allows the user to check if they qualify for a bursary 
I have added simpple comments the code and formatted it accordingly
Thanks !
